                    Never having found a safe space, we've used the internet to vent out frustrations we've had with
                    life for an exorbitant amount of time. We've been through therapy many times, tried to come up with
                    better coping mechanisms, and none of it has worked. At this time, the family is not safe to talk to
                    concerning mental health, so we have turned here. The internet is home to many types of sites from
                    different walks of life, so there is no harm in sharing certain things here. It's not the safest
                    place in the world, but it can be a place to talk about problems and coping mechanisms without much
                    judgement.

                <p>Choosing here over real life is depressing, isn't it? I wholeheartedly agree.</p>
                <p><b>I advise that you avoid this place if you are easily triggered, because unlike <i>up there</i>,
                        there is no filter here, and there never will be.</b></p>
