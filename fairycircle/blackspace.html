    <h1>So, what is the Dead Fairy Circle?</h1>
    <p>A location that has existed within headspace for a very, <i>very</i> long time.</p>
    <p> Also known as <b> Black Space, The Eyrie of Crows, The Graveyard, and the Blackened Ring,</b>  The Dead Fairy Cirle carries all of the Writers' repressed memories. It was one of the first paracosms ever made and carries a lot of significance to the older members of the Pearlia System.</p>
    <p> The multiple names of this paracosm are all reminiscent of different locations within it. Each of these locations have been added over the years as a result of different hyperfixations, and other outside influences. They all serve different purposes, and mean more to different individuals.</p>

    <p> We intend to add sections to this site illustrating the locations of the paracosm in the way we see it to see how it is interpreted by outside minds looking in. This will be a slow going process; it will not be finished any time soon because we have ambitious plans for the project. Check back later to see if anything has been added.</p>
